		<h1>CrazyTeenz</h1>
		
		<p>Our youth ministry, CrazyTeenz, prides itself in being a place where students can fall in love with Jesus.</p>
		<p>We believe that there is a lack of emphasis on teenagers in the church world today, and we want to go against the trend.</p>
		<p>We believe that youngsters can grow up to be the world changers of tomorrow, and it starts with us making an impact today.</p>
